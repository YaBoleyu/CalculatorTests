To run tests in Linux you'll need to:

1. go to directory with tests
2. run command `sudo apt install python3-pytest` (if you don't have package installed)
3. run tests by command `pytest test_calculator.py` 

Then python will run all the tests written in `test_calculator.py` file and you'll see the results of a test
